  <h2>  Overview:  <img align="right" alt="Coding" width="300" src="word_hateful.png"  >  </h2>
This project focuses on detecting hate speech in Arabic text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to classify Arabic tweets or texts into hate speech or non-hate speech categories. Given the challenges of processing Arabic text due to its unique morphology and grammar, this project employs preprocessing techniques and machine learning model.

  <h2>  Dataset:  </h2>
We use a publicly available Arabic dataset for hate speech detection, which contains a collection of Arabic tweets labeled as "Hate Speech" or "Not Hate Speech".

  <h2>   Preprocessing:  </h2>
Arabic text presents unique challenges in NLP due to its complex morphology and diacritics. This project uses the following preprocessing steps:  </br>

==> Text Normalization: Convert text to a standard form. </br>
==> Tokenization: Use Farasa Segmenter for Arabic tokenization. </br>
==> Stopwords Removal: Remove common Arabic stopwords that do not contribute to text meaning. </br>
==> TF-IDF Vectorization: Convert text data into numerical form using TF-IDF. </br>
